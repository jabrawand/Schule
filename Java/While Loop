# While Loop
The `while` loop repeats a block of code as long as the specified condition is **true**:

```java
while (condition) {
    // code block
}
```
---

### Example
In this code the loop will run as long as the variable `i` is less than 5:

```java
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Do not forget to increase the variable used in the condition (`i++`), otherwise the loop will never end!
