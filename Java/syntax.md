Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a `class`. The class name should always start with an uppercase first letter. In our example, we named the class **Main**.


> [!NOTE] Note
> Java is case-sensitive. `MyClass` and `myclass` would be treated as two completely different names.

The name of the Java file **must match** the class name. So if your class is called `Main`, the file must be saved as `Main.java`. This is because Java uses the class name to find and run your code. If the names don't match, Java will give an error and the program will not run.

# The main Method
The `main()` method is required in every Java program. It is where the program starts running:

```java
public static void main(String[] args)
```

Any code placed inside the `main()` method will be executed.

---
## System.out.println()
Inside the `main()` method, we can use the `println()` method to print a line of text to the screen:
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
  System.out.println("Hello World");
}
```

> [!NOTE] Note
> The curly braces `{}` mark the beginning and the end of a block of code.
> `System.out.println()` may look long, but you can think of it as a single command that means: **"Send this text to the screen."**
> Here's what each part means
> - `System` is a built-in Java class.
> - `out` is a member of `System`, short for "output".
> - `println()` is a method, short for "print line".
> 
> Finally, each Java statement must end with a semicolon (;).
